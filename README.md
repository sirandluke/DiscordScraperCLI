## Features

```bash
dsi get_json -a 38fl3hd9co -c 10083930 -d -f example.json
```

Prints the messages from the discord channel with ID `10083930` to console:

```JSON
{
  "this": "is",
  "some": "random",
  "blah": "JSON",
  "for": "now..."
}
```

And saves a full detalied list of messages to the file `example.json` in your machine's Download folder.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, ensure that your computer has Python with at least ***version 3.6*** installed. You can check your Python version number in your terminal using:

```properties
python --version
```

If you don't have Python or need to update to a newer version, [check out this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)!

Next, ensure that `pip` is installed as well (newer version of Python should come with pip preinstalled). If you're unsure if your device has pip, [check out this link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)!

### Installing Using pip

Coming soon... 8)

### Installing the Project Directly

After downloading the project, navigate to `/DiscordScraperCLI` directory in your terminal.

Next, run:

```properties
pip install .
```

This command will install all the neccessary packages for DiscordScraperCLI to work!

## ID's & Tokens

  Before you can use this tool, you are going need to do some digging first in order to figure out the channel id and your authorization token.

  Make sure you have a Discord account, are logged into the ***web app version*** of [Discord](https://discord.com), and that you either have ***Google Chrome*** (prefered and covered below),   ***FireFox***, or any other browser that has access to ***Developer Tools*** or some sort of tool that allows you to ***inspect network activity***.

### Getting a Channel's ID

  1. Navigate to Discord and be sure to stay on the web app version. Proceed to the server channel/private chat you want to scrape.

  2. Open up Google Developer tools
     - Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS)

     - Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux).

  3. Click on the `Network` tab.

  4. Scroll through the traffic and look for a request with `messages` in the name. If you do not initially see it, you may need to refresh the page.

  5. Scroll down to the `Request Headers` section. You will see a sub header called `:path:`. Discord formats their paths as `/api/{version number}/channels/{channel_id}/blah/blah/blah`. Copy the number that corresponds to `{channel_id}` and you are one step closer to being able to scrape some messages!

### Getting Authorization Tokens

  Follow the steps 1-4 as outlined in  outlined in [Getting a Channel's ID](#getting-a-channels-id). Now, scroll down to the `Request Headers` section. You will see a sub header called `:authorization:`. Copy the value and you are now ready to scrape some messages!

- Note: Unlike the channel ID, the authorization token does change, meaning you will need to open dev tools from time to time in order to get the new token.
